We have 10 dataframes. 

DF - Analyzing Accidents per Lakh Population-State-Year.
DF1 - Analyzing Offender and Victim Deaths per Gender, State.
DF2 - Analyzing Deaths occurred due to improper use of Safety Accessories.
DF3 - Analyzing rate of accidents from the year 2003 to 2016 for each state.
DF4 - Analyzing accidents/injuries/deaths occurring as per number of lanes.
DF5 - Analyzing accidents/injuries/deaths occurring due to various faults/reasons.
DF6 - Analyzing accidents/injuries/deaths as per the types of vehicles.
DF7 - Analyzing number of accidents which take place as per time of occurrence.
DF8 - Analyzing total accidents from 2003-2016
DF9 - Analyzing location of accidents for 2014 and 2016

and the exact names of the files for the above data description are,

df = roadAccStats13-16.csv
df1 = Details_of_road_accident_deaths_by_situation_state_2014.csv
df2 = Persons_killed_due_to_Non-use_of_Safety_Device_2016.csv
df3 = datafile.xls - total number of accidents from 2003 to 16 per state.
df4 = laneAccidents.csv
df5 = reasonOfAccident.csv
df6 = typeOfVehicle.csv
df7 = timeOfOccurence.csv
df8 = accidentRate.csv
df9 = location.xls

Each dataframe has been individually analysed using python libraries and packages like pandas, numpy, matplotlib etc. 
Each has been analysed for empty values, nan, etc, and have been handled by replacing them with 0(after analyzing the dataframes.
Each has been described ( for mean, median, std, Q1, Q3, min, max etc).
Each has total count record at the end which has ben separated and stored separately(which may be used for use later as per requirement) and the rest data has been separately stored and analyzed. 
The required data has been extracted, stored and appended to dataframe for use whenever required.
Each column in a dataframe has been analysed either separately or with the other columns as required for analysis.
Necessary questions have been answered either in statistical analysis or in graphical representation using python code snippets.
